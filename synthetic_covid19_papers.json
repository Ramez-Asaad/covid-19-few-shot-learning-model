    "abstract": "Understanding the role of treatment in COVID-19 remains crucial for effective pandemic response. In this retrospective study, we analyzed the role of medication and therapeutic intervention in 1535 patients. Our findings demonstrate significant associations between monoclonal antibodies and clinical outcomes (p < 0.034), with 81% of patients showing improvement in adverse effects. Our results highlight the need for continued investigation into treatment aspects of COVID-19.",
